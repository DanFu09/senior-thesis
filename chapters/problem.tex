\chapter{Problem Description}
\label{ch:problem}

\section{Flocking Model}
Like other studies in the literature, we use a simplified version of Reynold's
Boid algorithm \cite{reynoldsmodel} to model the flock.
In this simplified model, also proposed independently by Vicsek and
collaborators \cite{vicsek1995},
agents change their alignment at every step to be similar to the average
alignment of other agents in their neighborhood.
At each time step, each agent $a_i$ moves with constant speed $s=0.7$, has
orientation $\theta_i(t)$, and position $p_i(t) = (x_i(t), y_i(t))$.
At timestep $t$, $a_i$ updates its position based on its alignment:
$x_i(t) = x_i(t-1) + s\cos(\theta_i(t))$ and
$y_i(t) = y_i (t-1) - s\sin(\theta_i(t))$.
At the same time, the agents change their orientation based on the alignments
of neighboring agents.
Let the neighbors $N_i(t)$ be the set of agents at time $t$ that are within
neighborhood radius $r$ of $a_i$, not including $a_i$ itself.
At timestep $t$, each agent updates its orientation to be the average of their
neighbors' orientations:
\[\theta_i(t+1)=\theta_i(t)+\frac{1}{|N_i(t)|} \Sigma_{a_j \in N_i(t)}
\text{calcDiff}(\theta_j(t),\theta_i(t)),\]
where $\text{calcDiff}$ computes the difference between two angles, always
returning an angle between $0$ and $\pi$.

\section{Influencing Agents}
Should probably describe influencing agents and their limitations at a high
level here; look at introduction of the influencing agents section from Barbara
paper, or the influencing agents subsection from the Radhika paper

\section{New Settings}
Previous work has studied influencing agents in a small toroidal $150\times150$
grid, with neighborhood radius $r=20$~\cite{genter2016facegoalfacecurrent,
genter201612steplookahead}.
In this work, we study low-density dynamics by introducing two new settings
that are more adverse to flock formation; we call these new settings the
\textit{large} setting and the \textit{herd} setting.
In both these settings, we set the neighborhood radius to $r=10$.
% Before discussing these settings in detail, we note that our \textit{herd}
% setting is unrelated to Genter and Stone's 2014 herd experiment
% \cite{genter2014neighborsorientherd}.

In the \textit{large} setting, non-influencing agents are randomly placed in a
toroidal $1000\times1000$ grid with random initial orientations.
The larger grid size results in lower agent density; as a result, agents start
out much farther away from other agents' neighborhoods, and interactions are
much rarer.
However, since the simulation space remains toroidal, convergence to a single
flock is still provably guaranteed, so we are primarily interested in studying
the length of time to convergence in this case [CITE THIS].
In the \textit{herd} setting, non-influencing agents are placed randomly in a
circle of radius 500 whose origin lies at the center of a $5000\times5000$
non-toroidal grid.
When agents reach the edge of the grid, they simply keep going; in this way,
agents can get ``lost" from the rest of the flock.
As a result, convergence to a single flock is not guaranteed [CITE THIS].
Therefore, we are interested in studying how well influencing agents can keep
the non-influencing agents from getting lost.
