\section{Barbara Conclusion}
We have studied the problem of controlling flocks using influencing agents
under two new, more adversarial environments with lower agent density, and
have introduced some novel behaviors and placement strategies for these settings.
Besides these new algorithms, we have found that, in low-density
environments it is more important for influencing agents to
\textit{maintain influence} than it is for them to rapidly turn their
neighbors towards the correct destination.
As a result, earlier results from smaller simulation environments often do
not hold in the environments we introduce.
We have found that a multistage approach that first embeds influencing
agents in small flocks before attempting to steer these flocks to the goal
direction can be effective in addressing some of these shortcomings.

Future work could explore the design space of placement strategies and agent
behaviors by applying machine learning techniques to this problem.
Future work could also explore how to aggregate small flocks into one larger
flock.
Many of our behaviors result in multiple small flocks clustered around
influencing agents that have converged in the sense that they are all facing the
same direction, but remain disconnected from each other.
An interesting challenge would be to develop algorithms to merge small flocks that
start out with the same orientation, while maintaining flock composition.
For this challenge, a successful algorithm for an influencing agent must change
the direction of the flock without losing individual Reynolds-Vicsek agents on
the edge of the flock.

\section{Radhika Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented an evolutionary algorithm that evolves
ad hoc algorithms for influencing agents to control flocks of birds.
We evolved a genome based on a hand-constructed domain-specific language
and found that many of the evolutionary algorithms incorporated non-trivial
insights about the best way to be successful in a wide range of settings.
However, we also found that the evolved behaviors could be difficult to 
parse and somewhat unpredictable, especially when used as parts of more
complicated behaviors.

In the future, we plan on conducting a more thorough analysis of these
genetic behaviors in a wider range of evaluation settings.
We also wish to explore the design space of genetic algorithms more deeply
by evolving behaviors over different genomes, such as neural networks.
Another promising direction of research is to co-evolve different aspects
of influencing agent behavior to help agents co-ordinate in previously
unexpected ways.
Finally, we could also explore the design space in a different way by
taking techniques from reinforcement learning.

% \section {Future work}
% \label{sec:future}
% The existing literature studying influencing agents in flocks has almost
% exclusively focused on a simplified version of the Reynolds flocking model.
% In short, the simplified model assumes that the only inter-agent dynamics in
% play are alignment dynamics - agents tend to align their velocity vectors with
% neighboring agents.
% The original Reynolds model also includes avoidance and cohesion dynamics -
% agents will try not to collide with other agents, and agents will tend towards
% the center position of a group.
% These dynamics are important in real flocks, and in the future, the effects of
% initializing the cohesion and avoidance assumptions in Reynolds' flocking model
% should be explored.
% We briefly tested flocks with cohesion and avoidance dynamics throughout the
% course of our work and observed a major change in flocking dynamics when we did
% so.
% In particular, the introduction of cohesion and avoidance dynamics allows the
% system to be stable in an oscillatory state.
% This discourages flock formation and makes the problem significantly more
% difficult.
% Careful analysis of the effects of cohesion and avoidance is required to
% develop new metrics and influencing agent behaviors.

% Furthermore, in \textit{herd}, we believe the \textit{multicircle transition} 
% approach can be improved to more effectively steer flocks towards outer circles 
% without losing agents in the process.
% Similarly, further study of how to change the direction of an existing flock
% can improve the efficacy of our \textit{multistep} behavior in the \textit{large};
% perhaps a ``nudge, then follow" approach would be effective.
