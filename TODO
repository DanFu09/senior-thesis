Get rid of all references to global and local behaviors - DONE

Error range for Figure 5.2

Two graphs for large setting: one with face, offset momentum,
one step lookahead, coordinated, couzin, and multistep + face;
one comparing multistep + face to multistep + others - DONE

Then have one graph comparing genetic algorithms to best hand-designed
algorithms (probably multistep + face) - DONE

Herd setting stays mostly the same, but need to change some words in the
figures - DONE

Add Couzin to Fig 5.6 - DONE
